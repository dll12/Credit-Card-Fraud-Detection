# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Project Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection 

Description: Everyday there are huge amount of transactions take place worldwide, in some cases the transactions made are fraud.
In this project, we classify a transaction as Fraud or Legitimate using Machine Learning Models.

Dataset: The dataset is fetched from kaggle.Since the details of a bank transaction is confidential so the dataset has different features extracted by using Principle component analysis and the amount and time of transactions are provided along with the status of transaction being fraud or legitimate.

Project Detail: We splited the dataset into training and testing data with a ratio of 80%-20%.Since it is a binary classification problem, so we applied different supervised machine learning models to it.
We learnt about the feed forward and backward propagation in Artificial Neural Networks. The different models used includes Logistic Regression,Random Forest Classifier,Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine.

Outcome:The Accuracy from the different models are as follows:
	Logistic Regression: 0.999227
	Random Forest Classifier: 0.99964 	
	Artificial Neural Network: 0.99950
	Support Vector Machine:
